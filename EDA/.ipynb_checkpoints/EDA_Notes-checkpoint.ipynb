    "3. To fix missing values from the data\n",
    "    Blank data might not always be a missing data.\n",
    "    1. Depending on the bussiness problem that you are solving you can also delete the row or column containg lots        of missing data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. To standardize data\n",
    "    1. bring it to the scale that is understandable to us.\n",
    "    2. take care of outlier values and if possible treat them as missing value and remove them.\n",
    "    3. for character values better to make everything either upper or lower case.\n",
